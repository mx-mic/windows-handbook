### [Windows Ultimate Performance](https://github.com/MX-Mic/Windows-Commands/releases/tag/UP)

Activate the hidden "Ultimate Performance" power plan, designed to unleash the full performance capabilities of your Windows system. This tweak is especially beneficial for high-performance tasks like gaming, video editing, and rendering.

### [Disable Data Sharing for Windows 1x](https://github.com/MX-Mic/Windows-Commands/releases/tag/Telemetry)

Disable telemetry and data collection in Windows 10 and 11 to enhance your privacy and control over system data. Keep your information secure and prevent unnecessary data sharing with this script. This hasn't been tested, but may also work on Windows 8.x!

### [System-Wide Registry Policy Deletion](https://github.com/MX-Mic/Windows-Commands/releases/tag/Policies)

**READ BEFORE APPLYING!!!** Clear all (silly) system-wide registry policies that have been set by your company or if you apply it on your personal computer, may have been set by previous software installations or group policies. This helps ensure a clean system state and can resolve conflicts and slowness caused by unwanted policies.

### Custom Windows Vista and 7 Backgrounds (not yet available)

Enable or disable custom backgrounds in Windows Vista and 7. This script allows you to set a uniform desktop background across all user accounts on your system. Personally, I use this to enable a black background when I apply my custom Windows Classic dark theme at night on Windows 7.
